<span style="font-size:24px;">When</span> the pandemic shutdown was not completely ended, I graduated and returned to Beijing alone with two suitcases, wandering around Zhongguancun and looking for a place to settle down. I lived in Xiaonanzhuang for the whole following year.   


Xiaonanzhuang is located beside the West Third Ring Boulevard, to which I had a relatively bad impression for its heavy traffic and dust. But after a year in Xiaonanzhuang, exploring westward from time to time, I realized that my previous knowledge of this area was limited to the road itself. As I rode my bicycle around the Wanliu area to run errands, I found lots of interesting and useless "life hacks", and realized the endless fun of ordinary life.  


The most rewarding part of the year was that I got to see a different kind of scenery after briefly straying from the main road of my life plan.
