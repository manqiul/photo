When the epidemic was not completely unsealed, I graduated and returned to Beijing alone with two suitcases, wandering around Zhongguancun and looking for a place to settle down. I lived in Xiaonanzhuang for the whole following year.   


After four years of living in Zhixing Building near the west gate of my university, I thought I had an "exhaustive" exploration of the outside world of the west gate. But after a year in Xiaonanzhuang, exploring westward from time to time, I realized that my previous knowledge of this area was limited to the road along the West Third Ring Boulevard.  I had a relatively bad impression of the boulevard with its heavy traffic and dust.  


As I rode my bicycle around the Wanliu area to run errands, I found lots of interesting but useless "life hacks", and realized the endless fun of ordinary life.  


The most rewarding part of the year was that I got to see a different kind of scenery after briefly straying from the main road of my life plan.
