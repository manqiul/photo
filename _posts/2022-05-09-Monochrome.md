<span style="font-size:24px;">Monochrome</span> photography can help eliminate distractions from colors, and also convey stronger emotions.

#### Night, light, books

These two photos were taken in Seattle Public Library. Books can be the light.

#### Immerse in cities

We want to look up and see further, but it is difficult to do this when we are in big cities.

#### Lonely but not alone

It's just hard to understand each other.

#### Animals

This bird's shadow really looks like the boss of black organization in manga *Meitantei Conan*.

*Friends*, directed by giraffes.

Duck and cat, might be friends?

#### In real life

This photo is actually a selfie in the screen of television -- and because of this, it is originally in grey tone. I like this photo as it reflects my room in a mess, and I was like an audience, sitting before the TV, watching how my own life went.
