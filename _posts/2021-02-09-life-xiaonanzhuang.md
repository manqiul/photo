<span style="font-size:24px;">When</span> the pandemic lockdown was still going on, I graduated virtually and went back to Beijing alone with two suitcases, wandering around Zhongguancun 中关村 and looking for a place to settle down. I lived in Xiaonanzhuang 小南庄 in the following year.   


Xiaonanzhuang is located beside the West Third Ring Boulevard 西三环, to which I had a relatively bad impression for its heavy traffic and dust. But after exploring westward from time to time, I realized that my previous knowledge of this area was limited to the boulevard itself. As I rode a bicycle around the Wanliu area to run errands, I found lots of interesting "life hacks", and got the joy of life.
