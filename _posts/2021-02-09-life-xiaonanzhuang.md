<span style="font-size:24px;">When</span> the pandemic lockdown was still going on, I graduated virtually and returned to Beijing alone with two suitcases, wandering around Zhongguancun 中关村 and looking for a place to settle down. I lived in Xiaonanzhuang 小南庄 for the whole following year.   


Xiaonanzhuang is located beside the West Third Ring Boulevard 西三环, to which I had a relatively bad impression for its heavy traffic and dust. But after a year in Xiaonanzhuang, exploring westward from time to time, I realized that my previous knowledge of this area was limited to the boulevard itself. As I rode my bicycle around the Wanliu area to run errands, I found lots of interesting "life hacks", and felt the joy of everyday life.  


The most rewarding part of the year was that I got to have a different view after briefly straying from my original plan.
