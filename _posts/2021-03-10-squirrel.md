<span style="font-size:24px;">My superpower</span>: I can always detect squirrels around me:)! 

As a friendly observer, I never disturb those cute little rodents, instead, I stick to the principles of field research: "observe and understand squirrels in their natural surroundings from a distance". 

I'd also add some imaginations to my observations: "imagine what the squirrels are doing here", which is because: "what if the squirrels are actually smarter than humans but they just don't want to tell us?:)".
