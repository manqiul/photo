<span style="font-size:24px;">Humid subtropical</span>, the climate type of Atlanta, is the same as that of my hometown, Chongqing. 

But one different thing: this city is not surrounded by high mountains. This gives me a chance to watch the sunset everyday from my apartment, and record the magic of light.

#### Folding Atlanta

The building and the horizon split the view into four parts, and the glass reflects and segments the scene from afar. This reminds me of a sci-fi novel called *Folding Beijing*.

#### Piedmont Park & Georgia Tech Campus

There're not many squirrels in Atlanta... at least based on my observation. But the plants are so cute!
