<span style="font-size:24px;">Jingshan Park</span> is my favorite spot in Beijing. It is on the north side of the Forbidden City, and also on the central point of the south-north axis of the Beijing city. It's the place I'll visit whenever I feel depressed.

I enjoyed the moment of staying in the crowd, waiting for the splendid sunset. People around me were with different moods, thoughts, worries and happiness, but at this moment, we were together, vibing with the peaceful golden hour.
