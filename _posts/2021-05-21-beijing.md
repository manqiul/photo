<span style="font-size:24px;">Jingshan Park</span> is my favorite park in Beijing. It is on the north side of the Forbidden City, and also on the central point of the south-north axis of the Beijing city. I enjoyed the moment when staying with the crowd, waiting for the sunset. People around me were in different moods and with different thoughts. But we shared the moment together.
