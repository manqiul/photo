<span style="font-size:24px;">Jingshan Park</span> is my favorite spot in Beijing. It is on the north side of the Forbidden City, and also on the central point of the south-north axis of the Beijing city. It's the place I'll visit whenever I feel depressed.

I enjoyed the moment of staying in the crowd, waiting for the splendid sunset. People around me were with different moods, thoughts, worries and happiness, but at this moment, we are together, vibing with the peaceful golden hour.   


Switchfoot's song is particularly suitable for playing on a loop as an accompaniment to this scene: 

```
The tension is here,    

Between who you are and you could be,    

Between how it is and how it should be.    
```
