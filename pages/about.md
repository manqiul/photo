### TL;DR

<span style="font-size:24px;">Hey:)</span>, this is Manqiu, an amateur photographer for sure (and might never be a professional one). All I hope for my photos is that they can tell stories in everyday life, find beauty in the ordinary, and capture the moment where people around me are interacting with the world, and enjoying the life.

Thank you for being here.

### If I can say more about my photos and myself... 

<span style="font-size:14px;color:#acacac">(well since HTML doesn't limit the page length, I can write as much as I want:), so I'll just write more.</span>

#### Q1: A brief intro to my photo series? Which one do I like the most?

My favorate: 

- If you like `squirrels`, please do check out the "[I love squirrels](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/squirrel)" series!!!

For the remaining series: 

- If you'd like to see some `beautiful scenery`, "[Golden hour in California](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/GoldenHour)" and "[Old dreams in Beijing](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/beijing)" are good choices.
- If you'd like to get some `new ideas` from photos, please feel free to check out the "[Monochrome](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/Monochrome)" and "[Virtual and Real](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/mirror)".
- If you like photos recording `everyday life`, then "[Days in Wanliu East Road](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/life-xiaonanzhuang)", "[ATLANTA](https://manqiul.github.io/photo/Atlanta)" are always here for you.


#### Q2: What's coming next?

Great question. This site is still in a early stage, and I'm now working on:

- Take and upload more photos <span style="font-size:14px;color:#acacac">(of course)</span>.
- Make this site English-Chinese bilingual <span style="font-size:14px;color:#acacac">(mainly because I have better writing skills in Chinese, and I want to show off how good I can write)</span>.
- Add comment feature <span style="font-size:14px;color:#acacac">(if I failed, I'll delete this and pretend I didn't write it)</span>.
- More UI designs <span style="font-size:14px;color:#acacac">(I like do CSS work, which is true)</span>.
